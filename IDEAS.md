Title: Saving the Web 16ms at a Time

- The talk should open with a brief rundown of internet history, and the bold experiment of ungated communication. Some days it doesn't feel worth it, maybe snipe at Trump a bit.
- Mention Matt Perry's thoughts on the matter in React Podcast #35

- Reading designer blogs, noticing that designers will say things like "I've never had an engineer accurately recreate a transition I create in AfterEffects". The hand-off is rough. Part of this is because we use different tools... but part of the problem is just that we don't have enough attention to detail.

- Empathy for designers. When we're at a party and someone asks what we do, often we can point to the websites or apps we build. Designers have to add caveats... "I designed this, but X had to be cut from scope, Y wasn't implemented properly..."
