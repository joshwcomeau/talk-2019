          The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor
          (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows
          handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively
          than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can run the 64-bit versions of
          Windows.
