# üëãüèª Good morning!

---

My name‚Äôs Josh.

I flew here from Canada.

# üõ´

---

Flying is **amazing**

---

...but it doesn't always feel amazing.

---

Let's talk about

### Boarding

import boardRankedSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-methods-ranked.png'

<img src={boardRankedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import boardStupidSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-stupid.png'

<img src={boardStupidSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import mythbustersSrc from '../assets/mythbusters.mp4'

<video autoPlay src={mythbustersSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

...Of course, this assumes that people actually _follow_ the instructions

[pic of people milling around ignoring board order]

---

Clearly, there is a lot of energy around improving boarding.

And things have been improving!

---

import unitedSrc from '../assets/united.mp4'

<video controls src={unitedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

...But is boarding _really_ the biggest problem with air travel?

---

What does this have to do with anything?

---

# Performance

<TitleCard />

Why does this matter?

It's easy to make the case for page-load time;
If someone spends more than X seconds staring at a blank screen after
clicking the link to your site, they'll eventually bail. You get less visitors.

<img src={kijijiSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

Polished, professional experiences.

<!--

The rest of their experience is really important too. Smooth, jank-free
animations are what make a product feel polished and professional.

People like to use polished, professional experiences. And that's what they're
getting, in native mobile apps.

Look at the accordion in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example

Pull up the devtools, to show how much work is done by the GPU and in raster to get each frame painted

The Pixel Pipeline

<video

  autoPlay

/>

import pixelPipelineSrc from '../assets/pixel-pipeline.jpg'

export default LightSlide

<img src={pixelPipelineSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

# A better accordion?

---

# üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---

In my personal opinion, accordions are a **low-value** animation.
