# üëãüèª Good morning!

---

My name‚Äôs Josh.

I flew here from Canada.

# üõ´

---

Flying is **amazing**

---

...but it doesn't always feel amazing.

---

Let's talk about

### Boarding

---

import boardRankedSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-methods-ranked.png'

<img src={boardRankedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import boardStupidSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-stupid.png'

<img src={boardStupidSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import mythbustersSrc from '../assets/mythbusters.mp4'

<video autoPlay src={mythbustersSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import unitedSrc from '../assets/united.mp4'

<video controls src={unitedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Boarding is indeed important...

---

...But is boarding _really_ the biggest problem with air travel?

---

What does this have to do with anything?

---

# Performance

---

<TitleCard />

---

Why does this matter?

<!--

It's easy to make the case for page-load time;
If someone spends more than X seconds staring at a blank screen after
clicking the link to your site, they'll eventually bail. You get less visitors.

-->

---

# Mobile > Web

---

Polished, professional experiences.

<!--

The rest of their experience is really important too. Smooth, jank-free
animations are what make a product feel polished and professional.

People like to use polished, professional experiences. And that's what they're
getting, in native mobile apps.

## Relevance

<!-- Matt Perry's ideas about the web as a uniquely open platform -->

---

The web is an amazing open platform.

import codesandboxNetlifySrc from '../assets/codesandbox-netlify.jpg'

<img src={codesandboxNetlifySrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

It is incredibly **low-friction** to ship something on the web.

The web is full of delightful, oddball experiences because of it.

---

In order to keep the web relevant, we need to create native-mobile-quality experiences.

---

<AnimationIntroScreen title="Accordions" />

<!--

- Go to the bootstrap accordion demo, show how it works
- Pull up the devtools
- Record opening and closing
- Explain the FPS count - ideally we want 60fps. This is the native refresh rate of a lot of devices, and it's also just a buttery target.
- 60fps -> 16.6ms/frame
- zoom into a slower frame
- Focus on layout and paint
- Show how the ENTIRE PAGE is being repainted

import greenPixelsSrc from '../assets/green-pixels.mp4'

The Pixel Pipeline

<video
  src={greenPixelsSrc}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={{ width: 300, height: 300, borderRadius: 1000, objectFit: 'cover' }}
/>

---

import pixelPipelineSrc from '../assets/pixel-pipeline.jpg'

export default LightSlide

<img src={pixelPipelineSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Playground showing the different properties we can animate

---

# A better accordion?

---

We can't build _exactly_ that animation, but we can build something close.

---

import AccordionExample from '../src/components/Accordion/Accordion.example'

<AccordionExample />

---

"But design insists that it animates height!"

<!--

Talk about how engineers ultimately control what ships, and that we should
pick our battles.

Note that design is often so insistent because engineers are lazy. By going the extra mile when it is performant to do so, we build trust with design, and they'll be more likely to accept it when we say "this animation just can't be done performantly on the web"

-->

---

In my personal opinion, accordions are a **low-value** animation.

---

<AnimationIntroScreen title="Like Button" />

---

import Tweet from '../src/components/Tweet/Tweet.managed'

<SpacedRow>
  <Tweet tweetContents="Hello React Europe! üëãüèª" />
</SpacedRow>

---

Show larger, slower version of the animation

---

Dig into the code a bit for the original

---

import LikeSprite from '../src/components/LikeSprite'

<LikeSprite />

## Show the sprite version

---

import spriteMakingSrc from '../assets/sprite-making.gif'

<img src={spriteMakingSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Is this better? Dig into profiler

---

Show Vincent's animation analysis tool thing. Not only is it much less work, it isn't blocked by JS.
