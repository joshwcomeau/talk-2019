# üëãüèª Good morning!

---

My name‚Äôs Josh.

I flew here from Canada.

# üõ´

---

Raise your hand if you flew here as well

‚úã

---

Keep your hand raised if you enjoyed your flight

---

Flying is **amazing**

---

import flying1 from '../assets/flying-1.jpg'

<img src={flying1} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import flying2 from '../assets/flying-2.jpg'

<img src={flying2} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import flying3 from '../assets/flying-3.jpg'

<img src={flying3} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

...but it doesn't always feel amazing.

---

Let's talk about

### Boarding

---

import boardRankedSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-methods-ranked.png'

<img src={boardRankedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import boardStupidSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-stupid.png'

<img src={boardStupidSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import mythbustersSrc from '../assets/mythbusters.mp4'

<video autoPlay src={mythbustersSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Boarding is indeed important...

---

...But is boarding _really_ the biggest problem with air travel?

---

What does this have to do with anything?

---

# Performance

---

### Things we optimize for performance:

- Server-side rendering
- Code-splitting
- Reducing bundle sizes
- Lazy-loading assets
- Single Page App

---

### Things we don't think about so much:

- Everything after the page loads

---

import pieSrc from '../assets/pie-opaque.png'

export default LightSlide

<img src={pieSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

<TitleCard />

---

How did we get here?

---

import amazonArticle from '../assets/amazon-article.png'

<img src={amazonArticle} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

<Footnote

  href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales"
/>

---

import slowLoading from '../assets/slow-loading.jpg'

<img src={slowLoading} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import acSearchResults from '../assets/ac-search-results.png'

<img src={acSearchResults} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

### Humans are impatient

---

And we don't become <em>more</em> patient after the initial page load.

---

<FlexRow>
  <BigNumber
    num="100ms"
    description="time to transition UI when clicking or tapping"
  />
  <BigNumber num="16ms" description="time for each frame in an animation" />
</FlexRow>

---

import inputDelaySrc from '../assets/input-delay.mp4'

<ExternalLink href="https://input-delay.glitch.me/">
  <video autoPlay src={inputDelaySrc} style={{ height: '100%' }} />
</ExternalLink>

---

It gets worse with contrast.

<!--

It's easy to make the case for page-load time;
If someone spends more than X seconds staring at a blank screen after
clicking the link to your site, they'll eventually bail. You get less visitors.

-->

---

# Mobile vs. Web

<!--

It's a pain to get a mobile app. Have to use the app store, agree to terms, download several hundred megabytes, deal with annoying push notifications.

-->

---

Mobile apps are much higher-friction.

---

## Question

Guess how large the Facebook mobile app is?

---

export default LightSlide

import fbMobileApp from '../assets/fb-mobile-app.png'

<img src={fbMobileApp} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Mario 64 was 32 megabytes.

---

Why, then, aren't web apps dominant?

---

## One Reason: User Experience

Mobile apps tend to feel better

# Relevance

<!-- Matt Perry's ideas about the web as a uniquely open platform -->

---

The web is an amazing open platform.

---

import webflowSrc from '../assets/webflow.mp4'

<video autoPlay src={webflowSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

The web is _low-friction_ both for consumers and developers.

The web is content-rich because of it.

---

In order to keep the web relevant, we need to create native-mobile-quality experiences.

---

<AnimationIntroScreen title="Accordions" />

<!--

- Go to the bootstrap accordion demo, show how it works
- Pull up the devtools
- Record opening and closing
- Explain the FPS count - ideally we want 60fps. This is the native refresh rate of a lot of devices, and it's also just a buttery target.
- 60fps -> 16.6ms/frame
- zoom into a slower frame
- Focus on layout and paint
- Show how the ENTIRE PAGE is being repainted
-->

Properties like `background-color` don't trigger layout.

import cssTriggersSrc from '../assets/csstriggers.png'

<img src={cssTriggersSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

We should rely primarily on two properties that can skip layout _and_ paint:

`opacity` and `transform`

---

# A better accordion?

We can't build _exactly_ that animation, but we can build something close.

show off the product.

# Web Workers

We can do all of the art calculations in a worker.

Workers don't have access to the DOM, though, so painting to canvas is still really slow.

---

# OffscreenCanvas

OffscreenCanvas allows you to _paint to a canvas_ from _within a web worker_.

# Conclusion

---

## There's two sides to the "performance" coin, and they both matter.

Imagine the innovations we could come up with if we put actual energy into these problems.

---

We can help **preserve the web's relevance** by building good, polished products.

---

Smooth animations and interactions are a hallmark of quality.
