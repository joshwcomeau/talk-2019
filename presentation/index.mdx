# üëãüèª Good morning!

My name‚Äôs Josh.

I flew here from Canada.

Flying is **amazing**

...but it doesn't always feel amazing.

### Boarding

import boardRankedSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-methods-ranked.png'

<img src={boardRankedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import boardStupidSrc from '../assets/plane-boarding-stupid.png'

<img src={boardStupidSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

import mythbustersSrc from '../assets/mythbusters.mp4'

<video autoPlay src={mythbustersSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

Clearly, there is a lot of energy around improving boarding.

And things have been improving!

---

import unitedSrc from '../assets/united.mp4'

<video controls src={unitedSrc} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

---

...But is boarding _really_ the biggest problem with air travel?

---

What does this have to do with anything?

Animation Investigation

# Accordions

---

Look at the accordion in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example

Pull up the devtools, to show how much work is done by the GPU and in raster to get each frame painted

Explain how layout and paint is expensive

Explain that compositing is cheap, but it requires the use of 2 CSS properties

It's not easy to use them here to create an accordion

My advice? Don't bother with this animation. It's low-yield. There are more-fun things we can do with animation
