# Josh's 2019 Talk on Web Performance

Hi there!

### Code Snippets

The code samples shown in the presentation can be found in [presentation/code](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talk-2019/tree/master/presentation/code). They may or may not run. They're mostly meant to be examples, but if something caught your eye in them, have at it!

### Accordion

The live-running code for the accordion can be found in [src/components/Accordion](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talk-2019/tree/master/src/components/Accordion).

### Twitter Like Button

My twist on the Twitter "like" animation can be found in [src/components/LikeButton](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talk-2019/tree/master/src/components/LikeButton). The Sprite variant can be found in [src/components/LikeSprite](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talk-2019/tree/master/src/components/LikeSprite)

### OffscreenCanvas

My talk only briefly mentioned OffscreenCanvas, and truthtfully it's not something I have a perfectly-isolated demo for... but I use it extensively in [Tinkersynth](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/tinkersynth), and its source is open!

Thanks, hope you enjoyed my talk!
